Random f*ck generator for creting discussion at your online world.

This "tool" will help you to start a discussion in your social network about something everyday.

## Use

It's an easy React app, so itÂ´s simple.

- Clone it
- Open a terminal and go to the directory
- yarn install or npm install
- yarn start or npm start (whatever is best for you)
- Wait
- Wait
- Wait
- Open a browser at http://localhost:3000 (default, everything in default)

You will see in what you can begin with.

## Build time

Also, if you want to host it on your server you can do it by building it by running `npm run build` taking the build directory and coping it into your web server. The rest is all on your side!.

## New word, new colors

You can ask for a new word or change from the local json respository to a random work from Wikipedia by clicking on the menu at top right. Easy.

It have some bugs now... but don't worry.

## Future updates

This is a hobby application so don't wait until great updates... but I have the idea of:

* Use a timer to change the word every... I don't know minutes/hours
* Use several word databases (if I found some) or update the json file
* Use the browser language for the Wikipedia
* A way to update the local storage of words
